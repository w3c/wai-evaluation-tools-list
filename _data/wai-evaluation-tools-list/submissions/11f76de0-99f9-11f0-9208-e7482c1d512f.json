Its verification methodologies are strictly aligned with WCAG 2.1/2.2 standards and, as they are based on the EN 301 549 requirements of the European Accessibility Act (EAA), the tool is relevant and usable for accessibility requirements in all European Union countries. Please note that the 'ACT Rules (URL)' field was not completed because we do not use a formally published ACT ruleset in the W3C format, but an custom verification protocol.",
