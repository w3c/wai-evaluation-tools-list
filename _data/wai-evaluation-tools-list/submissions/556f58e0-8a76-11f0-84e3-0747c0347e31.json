  "comments": "After 25 years of WordPress development, we built Insi because existing accessibility solutions either don't actually fix problems (overlays) or miss critical issues (basic code scanners). Insi uses virtual browser technology to scan websites the way assistive technologies actually experience them, identifying issues other tools miss while providing actionable remediation guidance within WordPress workflows.",

Built by accessibility practitioners with 20 years of WordPress experience, Insi uses advanced virtual browser technology to scan websites exactly as assistive technologies and users with disabilities experience them.",
